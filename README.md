#Music Maker

###Description:
This site was made for a final project for General Assembly's Web Development Immersive during the week of 8/18/14-9/24/14 by David Javate.  Taking inspiration from Soundcloud and Stack Overflow, the purpose of the site is to create a habit maker for electronic music producers to get into the habit of making music.  Users choose a music creation related task then upload the result when they are finished. The User can then receive comment feedback from other users on their work.
